# CHERI: Challenging Environment Exploration Robot for Intelligence

**Mission:** Chang'e 8 (Lunar South Pole)  
**Role:** Locomotion & Mechatronics Lead  
**Institution:** METU Space Robotics Lab

## 🌑 Mission Overview
CHERI is Turkey's first lunar rover project. The mission involves deploying two micro-rovers to the lunar surface to perform autonomous exploration, formation driving, and scientific data collection.

## 🔧 Engineering Focus
As the Lead Engineer for Locomotion, my contributions include:

### 1. Locomotion System Design
* Designed a custom high-mobility suspension system capable of traversing **20° slopes** and clearing obstacles up to **10 cm**.
* Optimized wheel-soil interaction mechanics for lunar regolith.

### 2. Mechatronics & Actuation
* Selected and integrated space-grade BLDC motors and custom gearboxes to fit within a **5kg mass budget**.
* Developed low-level motor control firmware for precise odometry and slip detection.
* Developed a robust sensor set for reliable navigation and localization.

### 3. Thermal & Structural Analysis
* Conducted Finite Element Analysis (FEA) using **ANSYS** to ensure structural integrity during launch loads.
* Designed thermal management solutions for operating temperatures ranging from **-170°C to +130°C**.

## ⚠️ Confidentiality Note
*Source code and detailed schematics for this project are restricted due to ongoing mission parameters. This repository serves as a technical showcase of the public engineering methodologies employed.*
